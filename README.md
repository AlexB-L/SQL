# SQL Project

- This SQL project tested our knowledge of the language
- This involved using various functions to create/edit/manipulate and pull data from tables in a database
- The program that we used was Azure Data Studio
- Question 1 involved being able to pull relevant information from a database
- This often required pulling information from different tables using the JOIN function
- Question 2 involved creating our own table and inserting data into it
- Question 3 involved using information we pulled from the database and presenting it using graphs
- This was accomplished by exporting the data to excel and generating the graphs there
